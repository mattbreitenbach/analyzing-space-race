# Analyzing the Space Race

## Overview
This is a data science project that uses Python, Pandas, Plotly, and other tools to analyze data related to space missions from the beginning of the Space Race in 1957 to the present. It includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and various visualizations such as bar charts, pie charts, histograms, and choropleth maps. The analysis covers the number of launches by organization and country, the status of rockets, mission success rates, launch costs, and trends over time.
Created purely for the joy of coding, this project serves as a showcase of my skills in my personal portfolio. The inspiration comes from the course "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp" by Angela Yu. While the course provided guidance and taught the tools, this project represents my personal interpretation and application of the concepts learned, with most of the work being original.
